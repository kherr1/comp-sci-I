## **Student Learning Outcomes**:

1. Design, implement, debug, and test algorithms using a common programming language
2. Use good programming style, including descriptive identifiers and documentation
3. Design algorithms using fundamental programming structures: sequence, selection, and repetition
4. Perform functional decomposition using functions, parameters, and arguments
5. Use simple data structures like arrays, lists, and associative arrays appropriately

## **Texts and Materials**:

Students will have access to a Windows laptop for this course. All software and tools used in the course are free and can be installed on a personal computer that runs Windows, Mac OSX, or Linux if the student has access to their own device.

## **Required Readings, Presentations, Assignments, etc.**:

**Participation Activities:** This category will include tasks such as following code-alongs, recording information in notebooks, and class discussion. Participation tasks will be graded out of 2 points.

**Problem Sets:** This category includes written responses to questions or small programming tasks requiring only a few lines of code to complete. Problem sets will be graded out of 4 points.

**Small Projects:** This category includes more involved projects that require pre-planning and design choices. Students may be scored on a rubric or based on the function of individual elements.

**Exams:** Some units will include cumulative assessments. These will typically include a written and a digital component.

**Final Project:** The final project will require collaborative planning, documentation of the design process, and a functioning final product. It will be scored on a rubric with a group evaluation component.

| **Category** | **% of Overall Average** |
| --- | --- |
| Participation Activities | 10% |
| Problem Sets | 10% |
| Small Projects | 30% |
| Exams | 25% |
| Final Project | 25% |

## **Evaluation/Grading System**:

Numeric grades will be converted to TC3 letter grades according to the following system:

| | **Grade** | **Range** | **GPA** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| High Achievement | A | 93 - 100 | 4.0 |
| Good Achievement | A- <br/> B+ <br/> B <br/> | 90 - 92 <br/> 87 - 89 <br/> 83 - 86 | 3.7 <br/> 3.3 <br/>  3.0 |
| Satisfactory Achievement | B- <br/> C+ <br/> C | 80 - 82 <br/> 77 - 79 <br/> 73 - 76 <br/> 70 - 72 | 2.7 <br/> 2.3 <br/> 2.0 |
| Below Satisfactory Achievement | C- <br/> D+ <br/> D <br/> D- | 70 - 72 <br/> 67 - 69 <br/> 63 - 66 <br/> 60 - 62| 1.7 <br/> 1.3 <br/> 1.0 <br/> 0.7 |
| No Credit | F | 59 and below | 0.0 |


## **Make-Up Policy/Late Work**: Assignments will not be accepted after the due date, with the following exceptions:

1. Absences. If a student is absent, they will receive an additional number of days to submit work equal to the number of days missed. Contact me to make arrangements to make up work.
2. Extensions. If a student knows or suspects they will not be able to complete an assignment by the due date, they are responsible for contacting me and requesting an extension. The extension will be no longer than the original duration of the assignment.

Extenuating circumstances will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Missed exams may be made up at a later date; contact me to schedule a time. Retakes of unsatisfactory exam grades will not be permitted without making a plan with me to improve understanding of the content assessed. See me to discuss options.

## **Attendance Policy**: Please find the Tompkins Cortland Community College Attendance Policy below:

To maintain good grades, regular attendance in class is necessary. Absence from class is considered a serious matter and absence never excuses a student from class work. Unless otherwise provided for by the instructor, all students are expected to promptly attend, on time, every class session for which they are registered. If absence is anticipated, it is the student’s responsibility to inform the instructor as far in advance as possible. If a student is absent on the day of an exam or deadline, the instructor will decide whether the exam or assignment may be submitted late. In all cases, it is the student’s responsibility to find out what happened in class. Students are not penalized if they are unable to attend classes because of religious beliefs; students should discuss such absences in advance with their instructors.

This policy is consistent with my expectations in the high school classroom. If you are absent, it is your responsibility to make arrangements to make up work.

## **Student Responsibilities**: Your responsibilities in my class include:

- Come to class prepared.
- Treat classmates with respect.
- Collaborate in your learning. You should expect to ask your classmates for help, support them in turn, and work constructively with them while completing assignments together.
- Seek help if you need it. Programming is cumulative, meaning that each new task depends on previously learned material, so it is essential to prevent gaps in understanding.

## **Statement of Academic Integrity**:

_Find the College’s_ [_statement of academic integrity_](https://www.tompkinscortland.edu/academics/statement-academic-integrity-policy) _below and the_ [_policy for violations_](https://www.tompkinscortland.edu/academics/violation-academic-integrity-policy)_._

**Tompkins Cortland Community College’s Statement of Academic Integrity**

Every student at Tompkins Cortland Community College is expected to act in an academically honest fashion in all aspects of his or her academic work: in writing papers and reports, in taking examinations, in performing laboratory experiments and reporting the results, in clinical and cooperative learning experiences, and in attending to paperwork such as registration forms.

Any written work submitted by a student must be his or her own. If the student uses the words or ideas of someone else, he or she must cite the source by such means as a footnote. Our guiding principle is that any honest evaluation of a student's performance must be based on that student's work. Any action taken by a student that would result in misrepresentation of someone else's work or actions as the student's own — such as cheating on a test, submitting for credit a paper written by another person, or forging an advisor's signature — is intellectually dishonest and may result in sanctions and/or penalties.

Programming is a discipline that often involves seeking information online to supplement your own knowledge. This is encouraged, but it is essential that students ultimately understand fundamentals on their own. If a student uses online resources to develop code, they must cite the source they used in their comments. Further guidance on when it may be unacceptable to use outside resources will be made clear for individual assignments.

Students in violation of this academic integrity policy may receive a zero for the relevant assignment(s). If the violation is repeated, additional disciplinary action may be taken.

## **Additional Resource Assistance**:

If you need help with a topic or assignment, please reach out via email at [kherr1@dryden.k12.ny.us](mailto:kherr1@dryden.k12.ny.us), or schedule a time to work with me during Activity Period or a study hall.

Tompkins Cortland Community College campus and online tutoring resources, as well as study skills assistance, can be found at <https://www.tompkinscortland.edu/library>.

## **Appropriate Academic Adjustments**:

It is the College’s policy to provide, on an individual basis, appropriate academic adjustments for students with disabilities that may affect their ability to fully participate in college course activities or to meet course requirements. Students with disabilities should contact Carolyn Boone, Coordinator of Access and Equity Services at 607-844-8222 (ext. 4283) or [clb@tompkinscortland.edu](mailto:clb@tompkinscortland.edu) to discuss their particular need for appropriate academic adjustments.
